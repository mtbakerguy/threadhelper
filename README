This is a small infrastructure to make it easier to add small C/C++ libraries
for various types of data mining.  It currently starts up N threads (the -t
CLI option) and will hand stdin a line at a time to the underlying threads
(NB:  the threads access this by the get_next_item() function in the
passed in module struct (see oomkiller.cc's worker function).  It will then
join all the threads together at the end.

Additions to the micro-framework should be added with the appropriate
function pointer in the module.h file.  Likewise, additional modules should
be added to the Makefile.

NB:  be particularly careful if you use global variables in your module.  In
most cases, you'll solve this with Thread-Local Storage's use of the __thread
storage class specifier.  For the unlikely case where you do want an actual
global, you're responsible for your own locking.
